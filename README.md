# Git-Hub-College-Diary-Project
So I created this repository to maintain a digital dairy entry and to experience something like a blogger lmao
idk how much am i going to be consistent with that one but will try my best.

So my 1st day was on 20th August and today on 21st August was its orientation so i should'nt add 21st but there's something
special about it so have to do...so will rush these 2 days and then be consistent. :)
